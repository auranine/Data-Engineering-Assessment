TODO
===

- [x] Python App Setup (build config, lint, dependencies, etc)
- [x] Dockerize App
- [x] Stub .github workflow (NOTE: This setup would require environment (github pro account) to allow environments to have approvals to promote)
- [x] Documentation, Notes and Organization
- [x] Makefile for script wrapping/automation
- [x] Terraform initial setup (I set it up so i can run everything in my own AWS instance - which took longer)
- [ ] Setup s3, ecr and lambda via TF (along with proper least privilege setup)
- [ ] Ensure proper role setup is documented
- [ ] Manual Testing
- [ ] Configure NMD vars and run tf against that env and manually test
